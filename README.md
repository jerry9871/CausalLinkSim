# CausalLinkSim
This humble particle simulator aspires to demonstrate some physical laws as emergent properties from a few, simple principles.

	##	Preamble:

	I am not a physicist, neither mathematician, I am just a programmer. However, I have been always trying to understand the nature of the universe. I believe it must be
	reducible to a very simple set of rules with proper formalism, but the current mathematics is super complex and generates confusions, misunderstandings and paradoxes.

	## Inspirations and principles behind

	The simulation doesn't work with fields, but each particle has its own reference frame and the information is delivered from linked particle to the particle
	along the causal link at finite speed within that frame. Postulates I follow are:

	- Causality is fundamental and speed of causality is constant and finite.
	- Everything only exists relative to eveyryhing else. Without interaction, there is no existence in spacetime.
	- Block universe doesn't exist and the future is not determined. Observers can't agree on simultaneity.
	- Time is not intertwined with space, rather it's just a metric of interaction speed.
	- Field requires its own reference frame. The notion of field is a confusing mathematical abstraction.

	## Outcomes

	### Must have: SPECIAL RELATIVITY, ELECTROMAGNETISM

	- Electrostatic force is fundamental property of the particle and its chage, and the action quanta are delivered along the causal link.
	- Time dilation and length contraction are emergent properties of the particles and their causal interactions.
	- Magnetism is a time rotation of the electrostatic force vector, when observed as contribution from every nearby moving charged particle.
	- Light and other electromagnetic waves are emergent properties of the particles and their causal interactions. The wave propagation speed is the result of
	vectorizing together with advanced and retarded quanta delivery along the causal links.

	### Nice to get: INERTIA

	- Inertia is emergent properties of the particles and their interactions, and it follows the same rules as the electrostatic force.
	- The particle speed in relative to other particles is determined only by the causal links. The particle has no hidden variable to hold the momentum.
	- Mach's principle: The inertia of a particle is determined by the distribution of all other particles in the universe.

	### Super nice to get: GRAVITY

	- Curvature of spacetime doesn't need to include time, just space. My belief is that replacing 4D spacetime manifold with "space density" - 3D space manifold,
	will preserve all the GR/SR effects. There is just more space around heavier objects, which causes the particles to move slower from external observer's perspective.
	- Space density gradient causes the particles to move towards the denser space. Acceleration makes the object to experience more space gradient in the direction of accleration.
	This is the alternate explanation for the Einstein's equivalence principle.
	- Dark matter and dark energy are apparent and the observed effects stems from misunderstandings of how inertia and gravity works.

	### Super super wild and nice to get: QUANTUM MECHANICS

	- The particle is not a point, but a potentiality for interaction. Causal link is as fundamental as the particle itself.
	- Spacetime is a container where the particles can be observed, possibly emerging from the quantum substrate where also the causal links live.
	- Transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics ?
	- Do the quanta traveling across causal links cause the quantization in spacetime we observe ?
	- Pure speculation: Universe "optimizes" the interaction between particles, so distant causal links are not evaluated.
	 That's why we invented wave functions and Schrodinger equation - to describe the potentiality.
	When universe's substrate is forced to establish a causal link to an external system, this is when the observation and wave function collapse happens.
