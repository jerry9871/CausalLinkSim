# CausalLinkSim

This humble particle simulator aspires to demonstrate some physical laws as emergent properties from a few, simple interaction principles.

## How to build and run (Windows)

- Clone the repository
- Install minGW-w64 with MSYS2 and SDL3 packages
- Go to the folder and type `make`
- Run `CausalLinkSim.exe` to start

## Preamble

I am not a physicist, neither mathematician, I am just a programmer. I believe that laws of nature must be reducible to a very simple set of rules - with proper formalism. In my view, the current frontier physics and mathematics is super complex and generates confusions, misunderstandings and paradoxes. Rather than trying to understand the current theories, I am trying to build a simple model of the universe from scratch. I am not trying to prove or disprove anything, just to see if I can get some of the known physical laws as emergent properties from a few simple rules.

## Inspirations and principles behind

The simulation doesn't work with fields, but each particle has its own reference frame and the information is delivered from linked particle to the particle along the causal link at finite speed within that frame. Postulates I follow are:

- Causality is fundamental and speed of causality is constant and finite.
- Everything only exists relative to eveyryhing else. Without interaction, there is no existence in spacetime.
- Block universe doesn't exist and the future is not determined. Observers can't agree on simultaneity.
- Time is not intertwined with space, rather it's just a metric of interaction speed.
- Field requires its own reference frame. The notion of field is a confusing mathematical abstraction.

## Expected outcomes

### Must have: SPECIAL RELATIVITY, ELECTROMAGNETISM

- Electrostatic force is fundamental property of the particle and its chage, and the action quanta are delivered along the causal link.
- Time dilation and length contraction are emergent properties of the particles and their causal interactions.
- Magnetism is a time rotation of the electrostatic force vector, when observed as contribution from every nearby moving charged particle.
- Light and other electromagnetic waves are emergent properties of the particles and their causal interactions. The wave propagation speed is the result of vectorizing together with advanced and retarded quanta delivery along the causal links.

### Nice to get: INERTIA

- Inertia is emergent phenomenon from the particles and their interactions, and it follows the same rules as the electrostatic force.
- The particle speed is only determined in relation to other particles through causal links. The particle has no hidden variable to hold its momentum.
- Mach's principle: The inertia of a particle is determined by the distribution of all other particles in the universe.

### Super nice to get: GRAVITY

- Curvature of spacetime doesn't need to include time, just space. My belief is that replacing 4D spacetime manifold with "space density" - 3D space manifold, will preserve all the GR/SR effects. There is just more space around heavier objects, which causes the particles to move slower from external observer's perspective.
- Space density gradient around massive objects is equivalent to acceleration, because acceleration makes the object to experience space gradient in the direction of accleration. This is the alternate explanation for the Einstein's equivalence principle.
- Dark matter and dark energy are apparent and the observed effects stems from misunderstandings of how inertia and gravity works.

### Super wild and nice to get: QUANTUM MECHANICS

- The particle is not a point, but a potentiality for interaction. Causal link is as fundamental as the particle itself, or more.
- Spacetime is a container where the particles can be observed, possibly emerging from the quantum substrate where also the causal links live.
- Transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics? Does the discreteness of causal links cause the quantum effects we observe in spacetime?
- I see virtual immediate action at the beginning of the causal link and symmetricity of propagation. Can the causal link be the mechanism of quantum entanglement?
- Pure speculation: Universe "computationally optimizes" the interaction between particles, so irrelevant causal links are not evaluated. Physicists invented wave functions and Schrodinger equation - to describe the potentiality, but it is just mathematical abstraction, requiring a field metrics and leading to confusions. I speculate that when the universe's substrate is forced to evaluate a causal link from one enclosed system to another, this is what we call observation and when the wave function collapses.
