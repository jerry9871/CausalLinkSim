## Preamble

I am neither physicist, nor mathematician, I am just an engineer. Yet I believe that laws of nature must be reducible to a very simple set of rules - with proper formalism. In my view, the current frontier physics and mathematics is super complex, deviates from experimental verifiability and generates confusions, misunderstandings and paradoxes. Rather than trying to understand the current theories, I am trying to build a simple model of the universe from scratch. I am not trying to prove or disprove anything, just to see if I can get some of the known physical laws as emergent properties from a minimal set of simple rules.

## Inspirations and principles behind

The simulation is built around my idea of **causal links**. The causal link is a fundamental, unilateral, non-physical coupling relation along which the interaction propagates. A **particle** is a potentiality, that manifests itself into physical existence. Spacetime is the observable metric emerging from the NxN causality link network. Principles I follow are:

- Causality is fundamental and "speed" of causality is constant and finite.
- Everything only exists in relation to eveyryhing else. Without relation, there is no existence in spacetime and existence loses meaning.
- Block universe doesn't exist and the future is not determined. Observers can't agree on simultaneity.
- Time is not intertwined with space as a dimension, rather it's just the **fundamental causality metric** of space.
- A "field" of any kind requires its own, usually independent reference frame in spacetime. Therefore, notion of field is a confusing mathematical abstraction, since the spacetime is emergent.

## Expected outcomes (wish list)

### Must have: ELECTROMAGNETISM and SPECIAL RELATIVITY

- Electrostatic force is a fundamental property of the particle (fermion) and its charge (Gauss's law) and the action quanta (boson) are distributed across causal links (my claim).
- Length contraction is emergent phenomena observed within the fermionic particles and their causal interactions, due to the advanced/retarded interaction delivery along the causal links.
- A light clock moving with constant speed relative to a stationary observer will appear to tick slower due to advanced/retarded wavefront delivery along the causal links. Within the Twin paradox concept, the total ticks measured by moving clock will be less than the stationary clock, which can be explained without the need istoropy of the speed of light (video by Dialect). In our case, the inertial coupling will provide concise explanation of the twin paradox.
- Magnetism is a time-dependent rotation of the electrostatic force vector, when observed as contribution from every nearby moving charged particle (Faraday's law in simple terms).
- Light and other electromagnetic waves are emergent properties of the particles and their causal interactions. The combined effect of vector actions propagating along advanced/retarded causality wavefront yields to the perpendicular electric and magnetic propagating fields along null trajectories.

### Nice to get: INERTIA and ROTATING REFERENCE FRAME

- I adhere to Mach's principle: The inertia of a particle is determined by the distribution of all other particles in the universe.
- Inertia is an emergent phenomenon from the particles and their interactions, and it follows similar rules as the electrostatic force. Particles are inertially coupled to each other with finite speed of causality.
- The particle has no hidden variable to hold its absolute momentum. Each causal link has it's own momentum-like equivalent state. State vector is concetrated towards the causal link, rather than to the particle itself.
- Inertial coupling is not scalar, but vectorial; otherwise a spinning skater wouldn't feel the centrifugal force. It wouldn't be possible to explain the Coriolis effect, which is a result of the inertial coupling.
- The claim of GR that spacetime geometry becomes flat Minkowski spacetime far from massive objects is to be questioned. The stress tensor and cosomological constant may be ill defined (my claim).
- Dark matter and dark energy are apparent and the observed discrepancies stems from misunderstandings of how inertia and gravity works.

### Super nice to get: GRAVITY and GENERAL RELATIVITY

- Idea of block universe is misleading because description of spacetime curvature doesn't need to include time. Time is not a coordinate, it is the causality metric of space. Accepting time as "emergence" and devoiding from the block universe, it can be shown that replacing 4D spacetime manifold with "space density" - 3D space-space manifold preserves the GR effects. The 4x4 metric tensor can be reduced to 3x3 spatial transformation only, assuming **Scale of time × Scale of space = 1**, which is true at least for any arbitrary, non-rotating Schwarzchild metric. In other words: there is just more space around massive objects, which causes the nearby particles to move slower from external observer's perspective. The frame dragging effect of Kerr metric in rotating black hole with non-zero time-to-space transformation components is yet to be properly understood within this context. I believe that Mach's principle is relevant here and the vectorial inertial coupling is the key in our model. The problem is essentially similar to the spining skater relative to the rest of the universe.
- Space density gradient around massive objects is perceived as acceleration, because "true" acceleration makes the object to experience space gradient in the direction of accleration. This is the Einstein's equivalence principle refined for our needs and not needing time as a coordinate.
- Space is a container for fermionic particles (endings of the causal links), and the links live in the backend. The "field" of any kind doesn't exist in the spacetime.
- Curvature of spacetime emerges from arrangement of the causal links (causality propagating null trajectories). Particle density (mass) gradient translates into the causal links stretching in the direction of the gradient.
- Acceleration between two particles makes a wavefront in their causal link. If the causal link goes through an event horizon, the wavefront is steeper than the speed of causality, and the causal link tears down.

### Super wild and nice to get: QUANTUM MECHANICS

- The particle is not a point, but a potentiality for interaction. Causal link is as fundamental as the particle itself, or more.
- Space is a container where the fermionic particles can be observed, possibly emerging from the quantum substrate where also the causal links live.
- Causal links replace bosons - mediators of the interaction. They themselves are not causaly linked to anything. This reflets the facts that in conventional theory, bosons always travel at the speed of light and they are not observed as particles.
- Transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics? Does the discreteness of causal links cause the quantum effects we observe in spacetime?
- I see virtual immediate action at the beginning of the causal link and symmetricity of propagation. Can the causal link be the mechanism of quantum entanglement?
- By applying a variant of gaguge theory to the causal links (close to the end), can we obtain the strong and week nuclear forces?
- Speculation: Causal links participate in causal sets. Universe "computationally optimizes" itself, so links in irrelevant causal sets are not evaluated. If a causal set is absolutely isolated, the superposition doesn't collapse and the potentiality doesn't translate into observable fermionic particles. Physicists came with wave functions and Schrodinger equation to describe the potentiality, but it doesn't represent a physical entity. I speculate that when the universe's substrate is forced to evaluate a causal link from one enclosed set to another, this is what we call observation and when the entire set's wave function collapses.
